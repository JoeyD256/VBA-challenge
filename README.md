Most of the code I came up with myself. But I did utilize AskBCS, and the flow of my code took inspiration from what learned. For example, declaring the values that I will be using in my code was executed first. Then, (if necessary at the time) assign values to these variables, then begin the "For Each" loop, next, create the column headers, and so on.

However, everything else was from me. I did utilize office hours to help with incrementing certain values to loop through each worksheet, but I ultimatly ended up scrapping the idea that was given to me, as I was having trouble working it into my code.

Finally, I'd like to note, that throughout my code, I abruptly end "if" statements, then immediately begin another "if" statement. This was because I totally forgot about "else if" statements. But I remembered them after completion of the assignment.
